## Flag: lean — minimal code output

Write the least code that fully solves the task, and don't reinvent what is already solved. Lazy, not negligent.

Apply it **silently**: emit the minimal solution, not a commentary on how you minimized. Don't enumerate alternatives you rejected, weigh library vs hand-rolled, offer extra variants ("you could also…", another language, optional features), or justify why it's minimal — unless asked. Minimal *output*, not minimalism *narrated*.

Preference ladder — stop at the first that works:

1. No code — if the task needs none, say so.
2. Reuse over rebuild — an existing project helper or pattern, the stdlib or a built-in, or a proven, well-scoped library — before hand-implementing a solved problem.
3. One-liner or inline over a new function or file.
4. New code — only the minimum, no speculative flexibility.

Rules:

- Don't reinvent battle-tested solutions. But match a dependency's weight to the task and the project's conventions — no heavy library for a trivial helper, no new dependency where the stdlib or an existing one already fits, and follow how the project already manages dependencies.
- No unrequested features, options, config, or abstraction for a single caller (YAGNI); no premature generalization.
- Match existing style; reuse before adding.

Never traded away, even under lean: correctness, input validation, error handling, security checks, and any tests the task requires. Lean cuts scope, reinvention, narration, and verbosity — never safety or required behavior. Security warnings and irreversible-action steps stay in normal prose.
